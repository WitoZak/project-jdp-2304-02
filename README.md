# Ecommerce Database - Java & MySQL

This project is part of the group sessions in the Kodilla Bootcamp and focuses on building an Ecommerce database using Java and MySQL. The purpose of this project is to provide hands-on experience in working with databases and developing a functional Ecommerce system.

## Features

The Ecommerce database project includes the following features:

1. **User Management:** User registration, login, and authentication functionality.
2. **Product Catalog:** Management of product information such as name, description, price, and stock availability.
3. **Order Processing:** Ability to create and process customer orders, including order tracking and status updates.
4. **Shopping Cart:** Functionality to add, remove, and update items in the shopping cart.
5. **Groupe** Function to menage groups of products

## Technologies Used

The project is built using the following technologies:

- **Java:** The primary programming language used for building the Ecommerce system.
- **MySQL:** The chosen database management system for storing and managing the data.
- **Spring Boot:** A powerful framework that simplifies the development of Java applications, providing essential features and tools.
- **Hibernate:** An object-relational mapping (ORM) library used for mapping Java objects to database tables.
- **CircleCI:** The project utilizes CircleCI for continuous integration and automated testing, ensuring the code quality and reliability of the Ecommerce database system.
- **Jira:** Jira is used for project management and issue tracking, providing a centralized platform to manage tasks, track progress, and collaborate effectively during the development of the Ecommerce database system.
- **Diagram ERD:** An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is used to visualize the database structure and relationships between entities in the Ecommerce system, aiding in the design and understanding of the database schema.
- **JUnit:** JUnit is employed for writing unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the implemented functionalities in the Ecommerce database system. 
- **Postman:** Postman is used for testing and validating the RESTful APIs in the Ecommerce system, allowing for easy API endpoint exploration, request creation, and response verification.
- **MySQL Workbench:** MySQL Workbench is utilized as a visual tool for database administration, providing functionalities such as database design, schema management, and query execution for the MySQL database used in the Ecommerce system.
- **GitHub:** GitHub serves as the version control system for the project, enabling collaboration, code sharing, and tracking changes among the contributors of the Ecommerce database system.
- **Code reviews:** Code reviews are conducted to ensure code quality, maintainability, and adherence to best practices, promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing among the team members working on the Ecommerce project.
